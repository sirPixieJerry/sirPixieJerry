### Hi there 👋

My name is Jerry. I have lived in Berlin for five years now and I 💘 this city!

I'm an artist full stack web developer, part-time gamer, vegetarian and former squatter.

😄 Pronouns: he/him/SirPixie (yes I'm queer 🏳️‍🌈!)

I am currently looking for work. So please give me a job 👨‍🔧 so I can use [this](https://github.com/sirPixieJerry/sirPixieJerry/blob/main/alien-cat.jpeg) alien cat profile picture again.

-   🔭 I’m currently working on a page about origami and rings 💍.
-   🌱 I’m currently learning to pass coding challenges, [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a very special page with [Stef](https://github.com/StefAltavista).
-   💬 Ask me about everything you like. I'm happy to help!
