### Hi there 👋

My name is Jerry. I have lived in Berlin for five years now and I 💘 this city!

I'm an artist 👨‍🎨, full stack web developer 💻, part-time gamer 🕹, vegetarian 🥦 and former squatter 🏚.

I am currently looking for work. So please give me a job 👨‍🔧 so I can use my alien cat profile picture again.
