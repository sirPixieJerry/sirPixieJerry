### Hey folks 👋

I'm Jérôme (friends call me Jerry, like the cartoon mouse 🐭). I'm a **digital artist** and **full-stack web developer** with a strong focus on **quality** and **precision**. My goal is to craft robust, user-friendly applications while maintaining high standards for performance and usability. When I'm not deep in code, you can find me at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, leveling up my fitness, or playing a good game 🎮. Oh, and yes—I’m proudly **queer** 🏳️‍🌈 (he/him/SirPixie).

Feel free to explore my repositories—each project reflects my commitment to delivering **high-quality** solutions. I'm always happy to help or chat about anything tech-related, so don’t hesitate to reach out!

And hey, as a wizard 🧙‍♂️, there’s always more I can do—so let’s get creative!
